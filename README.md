# Cross Platform Docker Images

Various cross-platform (32-bit and 64-bit Linux) Docker images.

Created with [manifest-tool](https://github.com/estesp/manifest-tool).

This repo is only for images that already exist, and can be aggregated with a manifest file.  If an image requires changes to a `Dockerfile`, it will be given its own repo.
